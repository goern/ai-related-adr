# Architectural Decision Record: Document Ingestion Process Targeting a Vector Database

## Context

We are designing a document ingestion process to store, index, and retrieve documents in a vector database. The process should be efficient, scalable, and should leverage the inherent capabilities of the vector database for handling complex data like documents.

## Decision

Decision 2: Proceed with Vector Embedding and Indexing, and Utilizing Vector Database Features, while excluding Data Pre-processing and Transformation from the methodologies to implement the document ingestion process.

1. **Vector Embedding and Indexing**:
   - Converting documents into vector embeddings and indexing them for quick retrieval and similarity search in the vector database.
  
2. **Utilizing Vector Database Features**:
   - Leveraging the inherent capabilities of vector databases in handling complex data like documents for effective ingestion and processing.

## Status

- Decided

## Consequences

- **Positive**:
  - Effective indexing and retrieval of documents.
  - Utilization of vector database features for handling complex data.

- **Negative**:
  - Exclusion of data pre-processing and transformation may require additional steps or tools outside the ingestion process.
  
- **Risks**:
  - Ensuring data integrity during the ingestion process.
  - Possible increased complexity in managing the document ingestion process.

## Alternatives Considered

- Data Pre-processing and Transformation
- Specialized Tools and Operations
- Multi-source Data Ingestion
