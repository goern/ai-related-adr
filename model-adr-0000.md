# ADR-1: Foundation Models for Generative Text

Date: (today's date)

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The task at hand involves generating human-like text for various applications. The choice between utilizing a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) or adopting a transfer learning approach with smaller models is crucial for the performance, resource requirements, and delivery time of the project.

## Decision

The decision is to utilize a Pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) for the generative text task. The superior performance and readiness for use of pre-trained LLMs outweigh the resource intensity and black-box nature, making them a more suitable choice for this project.

## Consequences

By choosing a pre-trained LLM, the project can leverage the high performance and generalization capabilities of the model, which is expected to result in high-quality generative text. However, this choice also implies higher computational resource requirements and may pose challenges in terms of model interpretability and transparency.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Pre-trained LLM:** Utilize a pre-trained large language model and fine-tune it for the generative text task.
  - Pros: High performance, Ready to use
  - Cons: Resource intensive, Black-box nature

- **Transfer Learning with Smaller Models:** Employ a smaller pre-trained model and fine-tune it for the generative text task, requiring less computational resources.
  - Pros: Less resources, Fair performance
  - Cons: May underperform compared to large models
