# ADR 1: Vector Database Implementation

Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The need for a vector database arises from the requirement to handle high-dimensional vector data efficiently, enabling similarity search and supporting machine learning tasks. The selected vector database should offer a robust, scalable, and efficient solution to handle large-scale data and provide quick search capabilities.

## Decision Drivers

- **Open Source:** Open source solutions provide the flexibility for customization and generally have good community support.
- **Scalability:** The ability to handle growing datasets and query loads efficiently.
- **Feature Set:** Essential features like real-time ingestion, advanced filtering, and various search capabilities are crucial.
- **Ease of Use:** A straightforward setup, good documentation, and integration with other tools can significantly impact the development speed and ease of use.

## Considered Alternatives

- Chroma
- Pinecone
- Weaviate

## Pros and Cons of the Alternatives

### Chroma

- **Pros:**
  - Open source which provides flexibility for customization.
  - Feature-rich with queries, filtering, and density estimates support.
  - Scalable solution from Python notebooks to production clusters.

- **Cons:**
  - May require setup and management as it's not a fully managed service.

### Pinecone

- **Pros:**
  - Fully managed service which reduces the operational overhead.
  - Highly scalable and supports real-time data ingestion.
  - Low-latency search which is crucial for real-time applications.

- **Cons:**
  - Not open source, which could limit customization and possibly incur costs.

### Weaviate

- **Pros:**
  - Open source and has a good community support.
  - Quick nearest neighbor search capability.
  - Flexible data vectorization and is production-ready with scalability and security features.

- **Cons:**
  - The setup might require more configuration compared to a fully managed service like Pinecone.

## Decision Outcome

The choice has been made to proceed with **Weaviate** for the vector database implementation. Weaviateâ€™s open-source nature, quick nearest neighbor search capability, and its readiness for production with scalability and security features align well with our project requirements. The flexibility in data vectorization and good community support were also significant factors in this decision.
